## General Concept.
This is a project that started with the certainty of the lack of visual materials (images and video) for free (GPL3), available in a simple way and organized to be used in the development of tools or processes for the implementation in artificial intelligence or automatic learning within the agricultural sector. We believe that we can provide the data sets so finally, intelligent people will have the material to start working and testing.

### Project Images Dataset.
Our first step will be to create a set of images of a soybean stubble during 2018, which as a next crop will have soy again, in [Estancia Gerla (Trenque Lauquen)](https://www.google.com/maps/@-35.8854958,-62.7080981,207m/data=!3m1!1e3) and with some contextual climate and agronomic information. It is within our objectives to try different technologies of capture for the images. We are not sure about what quality is necessary today and less tomorrow, for sure we will do the one that is more comfortable and simple; since our objective is to achieve the "FIRST" data set, then it will be improved.

### Project Videos Dataset.

### Proyecto ejemplo de uso dataset.
Our second step will be to create a set of videos of soy stubbles during 2018, in Trenque Lauquen and with some contextual information on climate and agronomy. We will put the videos on youtube.

## Today.
Currently (10/23/2018) we have made three data shots. Clearly we have been improving and we assume that series three is how we are going to work from here ahead.

## Background.
During 2017 we concurred with Miguel Buero to the [AgBot](http://www.agbot.ag/) in Indianapolis. There we saw for the first time the detection of weeds by image and their applications in robotics and automation. Later we went to the [hackthlon](http://desafiospublicos.argentina.gob.ar/desafios/ver/HackatonAgro) made the innovation ministry in Rosario and we could see the work of the people of DeepAgro who went in the same direction. Part of the idea started when chatting with them told us that one of the problems they had was the lack of images to feed the analysis process. Manuel considered trying to reproduce the material here and one thing led to the other.
